# pscad-version-handler
Gives option to set which PSCAD version to open by-default and which on demand, just right click any PSCAD file and you will see the second option as "Open PSCAD" and then select the version to open with

## Steps:- 
  - Double click the setting.reg file
  - No second step :)


Help has been given inside .reg file itself, no rocket science, very easy to edit

========Thanks and once again I will say that if you face any inconvenience then remember God in mind and me in Person ==========
